I worked in the finance + production departments at Kate Spade, Club Monaco and J.Crew and then had a child and left the corporate world to fulfill my dream of partying for a living.<\/p><p>After event planning for 10+ years, I am seeing through my next chapter of owning my own store where I sell party supplies that I know, will bring joy into the community that I now live in.<\/p>"
